Your response goes here!

This assignment taught me how to build superscripts, horizontal rules and strikethroughs; which are tags we didn't 
cover in the previous lessons.

Paragraph, bold and italizing was very simple to grasp; I believe partly because we had more exercises with those tags.

Links were a little difficult for me to remember because I thought the anchor at the end of the element required 
an opening and closing tag.   

I think the MDN Element Reference could be a bit more user friendly for the HTML Dummies;like myself :) 

I referenced the Forum for help as well has the MDN Element.  I also had to refer to my notes and take a break before 
completing my project.
